# Overview

This portfolio website is a static project built entirely using HTML and Tailwind. This portfolio serves to display information about me, including my educational background, experience, skills, interests, and a list of projects I have worked on. In addition, this portfolio also provides a contact section to facilitate communication with visitors or recruiters. With a clear and organized HTML structure and styling using Tailwind, this project is a good foundation for displaying my professional profile digitally.
